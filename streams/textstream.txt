From a young age she began recording the history of the Pitcairn Islands, specifically that of Elizabeth Mills, daughter of a Bounty mutineer. She shared the history of the islands through letters, collecting historical information and personal stories. She also began writing articles about the islands and worked as a primary schoolteacher.[citation needed]
In 1894 she published a comprehensive history of Pitcairn Islands in the book Mutiny of the Bounty and Story of Pitcairn Island (1790â€“1894). Since its original publication, the book has been reprinted several times. The book is one of the few documentations of the islands' history and drew upon the direct experiences of several generations of islanders, including those of HMS Bounty.
Young was also a poet and composed the words to several songs which are still played on Pitcairn Islands.
